# **Job Application Customizer**

## **Overview**
The Job Application Customizer is a program designed to streamline and enhance your job application process. By leveraging your personal packet of documents (e.g., resumes, cover letters, personal essays), it dynamically generates tailored responses for job applications based on the content of the application text or URL.

### **Features**
1. **Custom Response Generation:**
   - Provide a job application via a URL or pasted text.
   - Automatically extract relevant details (e.g., required skills, responsibilities).
   - Use your personal document packet to generate customized resumes, cover letters, and application responses.

2. **Dynamic Document Matching:**
   - Identify the most relevant parts of your packet for a given job.
   - Rephrase and align content to the application requirements.

3. **Future Integration:**
   - Automate the entire job application process, including job discovery, submission, and tracking.

3. **Application Submission Module (Future Work):**

4. **Job Discovery Module (Future Work):**
